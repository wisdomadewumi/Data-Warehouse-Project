Create Database and Schemas
===========================================================================
Script Purpose:
	This SQL Server script is used to drop and recreate the DataWarehouse database. It ensures that an existing database with the same name is first removed, then a fresh version is created.
	Additionally, it sets up three schemas:
	- bronze (raw data)
	- silver (cleaned and transformed data)
	- gold (aggregated and business-ready data)

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING üö®:
	This script will permanently delete the existing DataWarehouse database, along with all its data and objects. Ensure you back up any important data before executing this script.
